My attempt at building a F# client for Kafka


Next task:
 - Done! Implement the rest of the serialization and deserialization. 
 - Done! Start investigate how actors and async tcp sockets work in FSharp
 - Done! Try to bootstrap the client with a metadata request
 - Refactor: Currently the Api.fs class is a huge mess, some functionallity should be moved 
    to a helper class.
 - Figure out how to do the produce loop
 - Figure out how to do the receive loop
