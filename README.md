My attempt at building a F# client for Kafka


Next task:
 - Done! Implement the rest of the serialization and deserialization. 
 - Start investigate how actors and async tcp sockets work in FSharp
 - Try to bootstrap the client with a metadata request
 - Figure out how to do the produce loop
 - Figure out how to do the receive loop
